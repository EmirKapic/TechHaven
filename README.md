## Request specification
The goal of the project is to enable online shopping, searching and checking the availability of items in one tech shop.

### User accounts
The user should be able to register his user account via e-mail. The user **must** register his account in order to order the product (but not before the ordering action itself), and his data (name, surname, address) will be remembered that way. It is not necessary to register before ordering a product.

### Shopping
The user should be able to purchase any of the available products using the available interface. At the same time, payment in this way is exclusively via card. If not already logged in, request user login.
Shipping information will be taken from his profile (except creditcard info)

### Product search
The user should be able to search for the desired product when using it. It should be provided with an interface such that it can choose the type of product, and then the manufacturer and, if necessary, the model. When searching, the user should be allowed to click on the product to open a window that will display more details about it.

### Wish list
Users who are logged in will be able to add products to their wish-list during the search. They should be able to directly purchase products from the wish list.

### Suggested products
The user should be offered certain products within the basic interface and be able to view them by clicking on them.


### Availability tracking
It is necessary to monitor the availability of the product, and inform the user during the purchase if the selected product is not currently available (all have already been purchased or similar).
When the user buys the product, update the database (reduce the number of available items)
